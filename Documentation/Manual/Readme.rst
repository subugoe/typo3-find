Find
====

This TYPO3 extension aims to enable the query and display of arbitrary Solr indexes.

It provides the ability to configure many aspects of the query – e.g. query fields, facets, filtering through TypoScript – and set up the display through Fluid templates. Partials for standard display features as well as a number of View Helpers that help creating those templates are included in the extension.


Aims
----

The extensions aims are to provide:

* access to arbitrary Solr indexes in TYPO3
* minimal configuration for a basic display
* rich templating abilities for creating complex displays


Basic Example
--------------

For the most basic example you need to:

#. add the find plug-in to a TYPO3 page

#. include the find plug-in’s template in your site/page’s template

#. configure your index information in the TypoScript template for that page. At minimum you should set the address of your Solr index and the fields to display in the result list::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		connection {
			host = solr.local
			port = 8080
			path = /solr/myIndex
		}
		standardFields {
			title = title
			snippet = publisher
		}
	}

   With this setup, find will give you a search form for your index’ default search field and display a result list with the document’s »title« field as the heading of the item and the »publisher« field added as a snippet beneath it. Each result can be clicked to show the detail view for that document which presents a definition list of the fields in the Solr document.

#. you can then add facets for text fields and numeric range selection, e.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		facets {
			10 {
				id = format
				field = format
			}
			20 {
				id = year
				type = Histogram
				field = publishDateSort
			}
		}
	}

#. additional query fields for an extended search option can also be added::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		queryFields {
			10 {
				id = title
				type = Text
				extended = 1
			}
		}
	}

There are many more TypoScript configuration options. Please refer to the rest of this document and the example configurations provided in the ``Projects`` folder to learn about them.


Example projects
----------------

A few example projects are included with the extension in the ``Projects`` folder. While you do not have the Solr indexes they are made for, they may give you an idea what more elaborate configurations may look like and how their templates are set up. The projects are:

* gbv: basic configuration for a big library index with multiple search fields and facets but without customised display
* hans: simple configuration for a smaller library index with multiple search fields, facets and mildly customised templates
* jfk-institut-zeitungen: simple configuration with a single search field, a non-trivial facet and a custom template without detail view
* edfu: elaborate configuration with two search fields, two facets and highly customised display
* germania-sacra: elaborate configuration with many search fields, facets, data export, complex queries and highly customised display
* test: configuration to demonstrate the settings of this Readme as well as the included View Helpers

These projects are structured in a common way (with potentially only a subset of the folders / files existing)

* projectname.ts: TypoScript configuration for the setup
* EXT-Private: symlink to the extension’s Resources/Private folder; this is used as a scheme to link the extension’s partials and templates into the custom configuration so they can be used in the custom configuration
* Templates/Search: typically some of these are symlinked to the originals
	* Index.html and Detail.html for the display
	* Index.data and Detail.data for loading data
	* Suggest.data for autocomplete / suggest responses
* Partials: Contains symlinks to the folders inside the extension’s »Partials« folder. If the default partials are to be overridden, a an actual folder with partials can be placed here. You can also add your own partials / folder of partials here. The standard partials provided by the extension are in the folders
	* Components: elements used to create the page
	* Display: create markup for fields in the document
	* Facets: create facets
	* Formats: various output formats used by the data format
	* Page: standard elements to add to the page
	* Pager: creates the pager for result lists
* Language: localisation files or symlinks to the extension’s localisation files
* Resources: JavaScript, CSS, images used by the project’s templates and partials


TypoScript configuration options
--------------------------------

All settings discussed in this section are inside the ``plugin.tx_find.settings`` array of the TypoScript configuration.


Connection to the Solr index
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The ``connection`` settings array is used to configure access to the Solr index. It contains:

* ``host`` [127.0.0.1]: hostname of the server running the index
* ``port`` [8080]: port of the Solr service on the server
* ``path`` [/solr/]: path of the Index on the Solr server
* ``timeout`` [5]: number of seconds before a Solr request times out
* ``scheme`` [http]: URI scheme of the connection

Solr Shard usage
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The ``shards`` settings array is used to configure Solarium to use a Distributed Search. The array contains datasets of a shard key and the shard itself.

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.shards {
	    shard1 = localhost:8983/solr
        shard2 = localhost:7574/solr
	}

See https://wiki.apache.org/solr/DistributedSearch for more informations regarding Distributed Search.

The search form
:::::::::::::::

The ``queryFields`` setting configures the search form. It is a numbered array of arrays, one for each query field that can be used. The query fields have a number of parameters depending on their type:

* ``id`` (required): the id for the query field; this is used in URL parameters (``tx_find_find[q][myID]``) and to identify the localised label for the query field
* ``type`` (required): the type of the query field; the partial with this name in ``Partials/Form/Fields`` is used to create the field for input form; the default set of partials provides the Text, Range, Hidden, Select, SelectFacet and Radio options, a few of which depend on specific code in the controller to create the right queries
* ``query``: a sprintf string with the Solr query for this field, e.g. ``title_search:%s``; if not given the default query ``$id:%s`` is used (where ``$id`` is the value of the ``id`` field); this lets you use more complex queries (e.g. querying several fields at once or adding ``{!join}`` to a query), it also supports multiple parameters (see the Range type);
* ``extended`` [0]: if true, the query field will only be visible in the extended search form
* ``noescape`` [0]: if true, the extension will not escape the user input before querying the index; this allows technically inclined users to run their own Solr queries; but it opens the risk of users accidentally entering invalid queries which will cause Solr exceptions (which the standard setup catches and offers the user a link for running an escaped query)
* ``phrase`` [0]: if true, the string in the field will be phrase escaped – rather than term escaped – before being placed in the Solr query
* ``hidden`` [0]: if true, the input field will not be displayed; however the field will be displayed if a term for it is passed in a search parameter

The default configuration sets up a general Text query for index ``0`` with id ``default``, as well as a Hidden field to transport the state of the search form with for index ``10001`` with id ``extended`` and a Text field for raw Solr queries for index ``10002`` with id ``raw``. Please be aware of these configurations so you can override or delete them as needed.

Some of the search field types have custom behaviour and specific configuration options.

Text
....

The Text field can be the simplest field available. It also allows advanced behaviour by adding autocomplete or a checkbox to select an alternate query style.

* ``queryAlternate``: an array of alternative queries that can be configured for the Text type; it creates a checkbox next to the input field which toggles between the provided ``query`` and the first ``queryAlternate``
* ``autocomplete`` [0]: if true, a field of Text type will be hooked up for autocompletion using Solr suggest query
* ``autocompleteDictionary``: name of the dictionary the Solr suggest query should use
* ``default``: default values to use in the query if no value is provided by the user (yet); may be a single value string (e.g. for the default state of checkboxes) or an array (especially useful for range queries)

Examples::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.queryFields {
		10 {
			id = name
			type = Text
		}
		11 {
			id = name2
			type = Text
			query = name:%1$s
			queryAlternate.1 = name:%1$s~0.7
			noescape = 1
		}
		12 {
			id = name3
			type = Text
			autocomplete = 1
			autocompleteDictionary = name
		}
	}


Range
.....

The Range field creates two text inputs for the arguments q.{fieldInfo.id}.0 and q.{fieldInfo.id}.1. This can be used with a query like ``from:[* TO %2$s] AND to:[%1$s TO *]`` if your index has ``from`` and ``to`` fields. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.queryFields.20 {
		id = year
		type = Range
		query = from:[* TO %2$s] AND to:[%1$s TO *]
		default.0 = *
		default.1 = *
	}

Hidden
......

The Hidden field creates an input element of type ``hidden`` to pass additional parameters through the form. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.queryFields.30 {
		id = hidden
		type = Hidden
		default = surprise
	}

Select
......

The Select field creates a popup menu. The popup menu is set up using ``options``, with the default selection‘s key in the ``key``. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.queryFields.40 {
		id = country
		type = Select
		options {
			blank =
			key = value
			key2 = value2
		}
		default = key
	}

SelectFacet
...........

The SelectFacet field creates a popup menu using the data from a facet that has been loaded. For this to work the facet needs to have been configured and its ``id`` has to be set as the ``facetID`` parameter. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		queryFields.50 {
			id = status
			type = SelectFacet
			facetID = status
			query = status_facet:%s
		}
		facets.50 {
			id = status
			field = status_facet
			hidden = 1
			fetchMinimum = 0
		}
	}

Radio
.....

Creates radio buttons for the array set in the ``options`` array. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		60 {
			id = version
			extended = 1
			type = Radio
			options {
				1 = Steak
				2 = Chicken
				3 = Pancake
			}
			default = 2
		}
	}


Default Display Fields
::::::::::::::::::::::

Two fields in the index document can be designated as the document’s title and a snippet that are used to display the result list. This enable a simple initial configuration and should have many cases covered. If you need to display more complex information in the result list, that can be achieved by replacing the ``Display/Result`` partial or – the ``Index`` template.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		standardFields {
			title = title
			snippet = detail
		}
	}


Default Query
:::::::::::::

By default all records in the index will be displayed when no search term is given: the query ``*:*`` is used for this. You can change this default query (e.g. to a query with no results)::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		defaultQuery = *:*
	}


Facets
::::::

Faceting can be configured in TypoScript using the ``facets`` setting. It is a numbered list of arrays. Each array can have the keys:

* ``id`` (required): ID used to identify the facet
* ``type`` [List]: the type of facet to use (see below for the types provided by the extension)
* ``field``: the Solr field to use for the facet, if not given the field given by the ``id`` will be used
* ``sortOrder`` [count]: using ``index`` gives alphabetically sorted facet entries, by default facet items are sorted by the number of results
* ``fetchMinimum`` [1]: the minimum number of facet entries needed to display the facet; the facet will not be shown at all if there are fewer entries than this
* ``fetchMaximum`` [100]: the maximum number of facet entries to load
* ``query``: sprintf style formatted string to use as a filter query if the facet is selected; by default the facet’s field is used with the selected term
* ``facetQuery``: array of facet query configuration arrays to use for creating specific facets; each of the arrays has the keys ``id`` to identify the facet query and ``query`` the Solr query to create the facet for
* ``selectedByDefault``: array with keys field value and values 1 to indicate facet terms that should be selected when no facet selection is given (especially useful with the ``Tabs`` facet type.
* ``excludeOwnFilter`` [0]: if set to 1 the filters created by the facet itself will not be used when computing the result count for its items
* ``hidden`` [0]: whether to hide the facet from display (e.g. to use the facet data in some other part of the page like a ``SelectFacet`` query field)

To change the defaults for these fields you can use the ``facetsDefaults`` setting and set your preferred default values there.

The provided facet types are given by the partials in ``Partials/Facets/Facet``. The partial is picked using the ``type`` configured for the facet.

List
....

This is a default facet list displaying the facet name with a result count behind it. You can use CSS to hide the result count if it is not needed.

* ``displayDefault`` [6]: the number of facet items to display by default (the remaining ones are initially hidden and can be revealed by the user)
* ``autocomplete``: whether to offer an autocompletion search field above the facet items (helpful for facets with many items)
* ``sortPrefixSeparator``: this string is used to split the facet’s name into two parts and only display the second part; this way you can sort by the first part (e.g. with zero-padded numbers) and still have good looking facet names

Examples::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.facets {
		10 {
			id = orden
			field = orden_facet
			autocomplete = 1
		}
		20 {
			id = band
			field = band_facet
			sortOrder = index
			displayDefault = 8
			sortPrefixSeparator = ####
		}
	}


Tabs
....

The ``Tabs`` style is a slight variation of the plain list. As the name suggests, it can be used to create »Tabs« above the search results to allow users to pick a view on a certain subset of the data. This can be particularly useful with predefined facet queries to define the desired subsets.

You will have to add the partial for this type of facet to your template yourself to make it appear at the top of the page. When doing so use the ``hidden`` setting to ensure it does not appear along with the other facets as well. Turning on the ``excludeOwnFilter`` setting will ensure you get correct result counts for the facet items which are not currently selected.

Example: a Tabs facet with facet queries for four specific document »typ« values, selecting the »formular« option by default::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.facets {
		30 {
			id = typ
			excludeOwnFilter = 1
			type = Tabs
			hidden = 1
			selectedByDefault {
				formular = 1
			}
			facetQuery {
				10 {
					id = formular
					query = typ:formular
				}
				20 {
					id = wort
					query = typ:wort
				}
				30 {
					id = gott
					query = typ:gott
				}
				40 {
					id = ort
					query = typ:ort
				}
			}
		}
	}



Histogram
.........

This facet is made for numeric fields. It will draw a histogram to visualise the number of results per number in the index. It is a nice way to visualise a »year« facet. You typically want a high ``fetchMaximum`` setting for the histogram facet.

* ``barWidth``: the »width« of each of the bars in the histogram; if you cover a wide number range it can be worthwhile to group the bars in wider ranges; doing so requires an index that already contains rounded data (e.g. the rounded number of the decade instead of the precise year)

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.facets {
		40 {
			id = decade
			field = decade
			type = Histogram
			sortOrder = index
			fetchMaximum = 1000
			barWidth = 10
		}
	}

Map
...

This face creates a tiny Google map from a Solr field containing specifically formatted geohashes. Please look at the ``Partials/Facets/Facet/Map.html`` partial for details. (This can still be improved in many ways.)

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.facets {
		50 {
			id = map
			field = geohash
			type = Map
			sortOrder = index
			fetchMaximum = 1000
		}
	}


Sorting
:::::::

Sort behaviour can be configured using the ``sort`` setting. It is an array of arrays with the fields ``id`` and ``sortCriteria``. The latter is a Solr sort order string, i.e. a comma-separated list of the form ``fieldName [a|de]sc``. The ``id`` of the default sort order should be ``default``.

If the array has several elements, a popup menu for selecting the sort order is added to the user interface.

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.sort {
		1 {
			id = default
			sortCriteria = year desc,name asc
		}
	}


Paging
::::::

Use the ``paging`` setting to adjust navigation in the results. In this array you can set:

* ``perPage`` [20]: the number of results per page
* ``menu`` [array()]: array of numbers used to create a menu from which users can pick the number of results per page
* ``maximumPerPage`` [1000]: the maximum number of results to fetch from Solr, even if the query asks for more
* ``detailPagePaging`` [1]: if 1 this enables paging between detail pages for a search

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.paging {
		perPage = 100
		maximumPerPage = 1000
		detailPagePaging = 1
	}


Detail Page Paging
..................

The ``detailPagePaging`` option enables a feature that lets you have pretty and unique URLs for the pages corresponding to your Solr documents when RealURL is used *and* have paging between a result’s detail page and the detail pages before and after it.

This is achieved by POSTing information about the previous query along with the ID of the requested record sent in the URL. A drawback of this solution is that using the browser’s back button may trigger a »Do you want to submit this form again?« dialogue. Turn this option off if you don’t need paging between the detail pages.

URL Parameters
..............

You can also set the the number of results and the initial document in a server reply using the ``count`` and ``position`` arguments. The ``count`` will be limited by the ``maximumPerPage`` setting.



Excluding documents
:::::::::::::::::::

If your index contains documents that should never be shown (e.g. because they are not published yet or because you are using them for search but ``{!join}`` them to other documents for display), you can add filter queries using the ``additionalFilters`` setting. The setting is an array with the filter queries as values::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.additionalFilters {
		1 = published:true
	}


Choosing the fields to fetch
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

By default the complete Solr document is loaded and all its fields can be used. If your documents are very large or you want to avoid unnecessary highlighting, it can be useful to explicitly state which fields are to be fetched. The ``dataFields`` setting lets you do this. It has four sections ``default``, ``index``, ``detail``, ``data``. The extension will start with the fields configured in ``default`` and add the fields given in the array for the action that is used.

Each of these sections is an array with keys ``default`` (again), ``allow`` and ``disallow``. Typically you will only need the ``default`` array but the other keys can be used to force-add fields or explicitly prohibit the output of fields. (Please note that this will not be a failsafe guarantee that users cannot see those field due to the various actions or field name wildcards.) You may also use the ``data-fields`` argument in action URLs to overwrite the ``default`` configuration. For technical reasons the keys for the fields need to begin with a letter rather than just be a number (e.g. use ``f1`` instead of ``1``).

Example configuration to only load minimal fields by default and load all fields for the ``detail`` and ``data`` actions::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		dataFields {
			default {
				default {
					f0 = id
					f1 = kloster
				}
			}
			detail {
				default {
					f0 = *
				}
			}
			data < plugin.tx_find.settings.dataFields.detail
		}
	}


Highlighting
::::::::::::

The use of Solr’s result highlighting is configured by the ``highlight`` setting. Similar to the ``dataFields`` setting, it contains arrays ``default``, ``index``, ``detail`` and ``data``. Each of which can contain the following fields:

* ``fields`` [{f1 = \*}]: an array of field names; its keys should begin with a letter for technical reasons (i.e ``f1`` instead of ``1``
* ``fragsize`` [100]: the maximum length of the highlighted fragment
* ``query``: a custom sprintf-style query templat to use for highlighting
* ``useQueryTerms`` [0]: set to 1 to create highlight queries for each query term from the search form
* ``useFacetTerms`` [0]: set to 1 to create highlight queries for each selected facet term
* ``alternateFields``: an array with keys the field name and values the corresponding alternate field name for situations where the highlighting does not work in the field itself

Please note that particularly the final three options do not seem ideal yet and are considered experimental. Changes may be needed in the future to make these more versatile in complicated situations.

Example highlighting just a few fields by default and a wider range of fields for the ``detail`` action. As it is used with ``{!join}`` queries, the terms from queries and facets are explicitly added again for highligh queries::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.highlight {
		default {
			fields {
				f1 = kloster
			}
			useQueryTerms = 1
			useFacetTerms = 1
		}
		detail {
			fields {
				f2 = patrozinium
				f3 = ort
				f4 = bistum
				f5 = land
				f6 = orden
				f7 = bemerkung_kloster
			}
		}
	}


Linking to data fields
::::::::::::::::::::::

When displaying field content with the ``Partials/Display/Field/Content`` partial (or its siblings who use it) the ``linkFieldContent`` argument can be give to not just display the field content but insert a link to search all documents with the same value in that field. Without further configuration this will create a ``raw`` query where the user may see the Solr query. It can be desirable to instead hide the Solr query syntax and define a (potentially ``hidden``) query field for that Solr field and then just fill that field with the term only.

The ``queryFieldForDataField`` setting is an array with keys Solr field names and values IDs of ``queryFields`` which creates the mapping needed for creating those queries.

Example::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		queryFields {
			100 {
				id = city
				type = Text
				hidden = 1
				phrase = 1
			}

		queryFieldForDataField {
			city = city
		}
	}


Jumping to the content
::::::::::::::::::::::

By default the extension creates links that jump to the extension’s content (``#tx_find``) on the target page to maximise the visible space for search results and information that may otherwise be wasted for the page’s head. You can remove the anchor to jump to or pick another one on your page (e.g. to leave site navigation visible) with the ``jumpToID`` setting::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.jumpToID = menu


JavaScript and CSS resources
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Settings include the ``JSPaths`` and ``CSSPaths`` arrays which can be used to configure JavaScript and CSS files to be added to the page. The default setup configures files at positions ``10`` and ``20`` of ``CSSPaths`` and at position ``10`` of ``JSPaths``. E.g.::

	plugin.tx_find.settings {
		CSSPaths.30 = EXT:find/Projects/test/Resources/test.css
		JSPaths.20 = EXT:find/Projects/test/Resources/test.js
	}


Localisation
::::::::::::

You can set the ``languageRootPath`` pointing to your own ``Localisations`` folder. The partials included with the extension will honour that path when accessing their localisation files. As with the partials and templates it can be handy to symlink some of the default localisation files and just override or add the additional terminology you need::

	plugin.tx_find.settings.languageRootPath = EXT:find/Projects/test/Language/

Localisation files used by the included partials are:

* locallang.xml: general terminology for the search interface (the default file)
* locallang-form.xml: labels and placeholders for the search form
* locallang-facets.xml: facet names and facet item names
* locallang-fields.xml: field labels

Please refer to the initial comments in those files for the conventions used to create the localisation keys based on the ``id`` s of the respective query fields, facets or fields.


Templating
----------

You probably want to create your own templates and partials to tailor the display of your search results for your index content. To do that create a project structure along the lines of the included example projects, symlink the parts of the extension’s templates and partials you want to use and override/add your own.

The extension comes with a large number of View Helpers and partials that can be helpful in that context. Look around the ``Classes/ViewHelpers`` and ``Resources/Private/Partials`` folders to see which parts of the work have already been done for you.

Most of the View Helpers come with usage examples in the ``Test`` partial of the ``test`` project and appear on its start page (the search interface appears after those examples) once you have it set up.


Actions
-------

The extension provides three actions:

* ``index``: the default action that performs searches
* ``detail``: the action to display a single document (automatically triggered if the ``id`` argument is present)
* ``suggest``: used for the autocomplete setup of Text query fields


Data export
-----------

Creating data exports requires the following setup:

* set up a TYPO3 page type without HTML and the MIME Type you need; the extension provides type ``1369315139`` one for JSON::

	tx_find_page = PAGE
	tx_find_page {
		typeNum = 1369315139
		10 < tt_content.list.20.find_find
		config {
			disableAllHeaderCode = 1
			additionalHeaders = Content-type:application/json;charset=utf-8
		}
	}

* create a link with ``f:link.action`` using the ``pageType`` you need, ``format="data"`` and add the argument ``data-format`` with the name of the format you want to the query

* create a partial for your data format in ``Partials/Formats`` with the ``.data`` file name extension and create the desired output there.

Example output formats, e.g. for JSON, are available in the extension. The germania-sacra project contains additional ones.


Query String Arguments
----------------------

The plug-in’s query parameters are of the form ``tx_find_find[parameterName]``.

Standard arguments
::::::::::::::::::

Built-in parameter names are

* ``id``: the Solr document ID of the document to show in the detail action; having the id argument will always trigger the detail action
* ``q``: for the query; this is an array with keys the queryField IDs, e.g. ``tx_find_find[q][default]=term``; some query field types (e.g. Range) use an array as their value to cover both their input values
* ``facet``: for selected facets; this is an array with keys the facet IDs, and values arrays; those arrays have keys the facet term and value 1, e.g. ``tx_find_find[facet][typ][formular]=1``
* ``page``: the page of results to show (1-based)
* ``extended``: whether to show the extended search form
* ``sort``: the sort order to use

Special arguments
:::::::::::::::::

These arguments are not typically exposed but can be useful when providing data exports through the extension, specifically when using the data action.

* ``start``: the document index to start at in the result set
* ``count``: the number of documents to ask Solr for (limited by the ``paging.maximumPerPage`` setting)
* ``data-format``: when using the ``data`` format, this file in ``Partials/Formats`` will be used to create the output

POST arguments
::::::::::::::
* ``underlyingQuery``: information about the underlying query, sent in the POST body when ``paging.detailPagePaging`` is turned on; it may contain the keys ``q``, ``facet``, ``position``, ``count`` and ``sort``.


RealURL
-------

The extension includes a hook for RealURL autoconfiguration. It mainly handles the parameter name for the detail view by using a ``id/documentID`` path segment.

URLs for queries and faceting are not prettified and – if required – will need to be manually configured due to the query parameter names depending on the ``id`` s used for fields and facets.
