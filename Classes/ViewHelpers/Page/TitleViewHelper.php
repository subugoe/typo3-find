         * 3. Manually replace the existing page title with the one we want if $GLOBALS['TSFE']->content is non-empty

         *
         * Apart from the general hackishness of this approach, it relies on the pre-set page title only
         * appearing once inside the <title> tag. Otherwise the order of the components in the page title will be wrong.
